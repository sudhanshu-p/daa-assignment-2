# DAA-assignment-2
In this Assignment, the problem was that given an array of numbers and a target sum, print all the possible subsets of the array such that the sum of each subset is equal to the target sum.
This is solved using BackTracing. We will check the sum of the numbers of an array by progressively adding 1 number from the array into the sum, and if the sum becomes greater than the target, we will go back.

Demonstration: 

Case 1: 
Arr = [7, 2, 6, 11, 5]
target = 13

Output:

Case 2: 

Arr = [1, 5, 11, 5]
target = 11
